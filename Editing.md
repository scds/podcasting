## Before Editing Checklist

Before you begin to edit your podcast, there are a few things you should consider:
- Transfer your audio files to your computer and place them in a folder.
- Sort through your audio files, renaming the files accordingly.
- Create backup copies of your unedited audio files in a separate folder.
- Use headphones instead of solely relying on your computer’s speakers.
- Keep your script nearby – This will act as a guide as you edit.
- And of course, downloading and installing an audio editing program. But which one?

## Learn to Edit Audio on Audacity

Audacity is a free audio editing software. Because of its accessibility, it's our preferred platform. Watch the video below to learn how to use the program. Elaine will show you how to cut out unwanted noises, reduce background noise, add background music, and more.

## Audacity Editing Activity

Want hands-on experience with editing audio in Audacity? Complete the following activity. 

First, download [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/). 
Second, watch Elaine's [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci3QnCj9nHc&t=64s) and get used to navigating the program. 
Third, download [three files](https://mcmasteru365-my.sharepoint.com/personal/westenev_mcmaster_ca/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fwestenev%5Fmcmaster%5Fca%2FDocuments%2FWorkshops%2Fpodcasts%2Dveronica%2Fteaching%2Dand%2Dlearning%2Dmonth%2DVERSION%2Faudio%2Dfiles%2Dfor%2Dworkshop&ga=1). One is music, one is an interview, and one is a PDF guide to the activity. 
Fourth, follow the instructions in the PDF guide. 

By the end of the activity, you will know how to import, cut, split, compress, amplify, and export audio. You will also learn how to add music and adjust volume.

## Copyright Concerns

Many podcasts use music at some point in the episode. If you do not have the budget to hire a composer, browse repositories like [Pixabay] (https://pixabay.com/music/search/theme/music%20for%20videos/) and the YouTube Audio Library for audio that you can legally use in your show. Note that the YouTube Audio Library cannot be linked because it is accessed through the "Creator Studio"--which simply means that you need a (free) YouTube account to access the files.

## Next Steps
Now that you've edited your episode, it's time to think about [branding your show.](https://scds.github.io/podcasting/branding.html)
