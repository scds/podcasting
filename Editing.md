## Before Editing Checklist

Before you begin to edit your podcast, there are a few things you should consider:
- Transfer your audio files to your computer and place them in a folder.
- Sort through your audio files, renaming the files accordingly.
- Create backup copies of your unedited audio files in a separate folder.
- Use headphones instead of solely relying on your computer’s speakers.
- Keep your script nearby – This will act as a guide as you edit.
- And of course, downloading and installing an audio editing program. But which one?
