Most of the time, new listeners don’t encounter podcasts as audio. 

They encounter them visually and textually through three things:

1. Show Title 
2. Description/Logline 
- Brief 1-2 sentence description of the show’s content, format, and tone
3. Tile Image 
- Rhe image that will represent the show on podcatchers and distributors. Sometimes called "graphic collateral," this image includes an image, symbol, and/or font, all of which convey meaning. 

Collectively, these three things must hook listeners by conveying a tremendous amount of information (topic, tone, the show’s identity) in a very small space. The big takeaway: Don't underestimate the power of good branding. Be as intentional and thoughtful as possible when you design your show's tile iamge, logline, and title. 

Let's look at an example of a podcast that branded itself well: Karina Longworth's Old Hollywood podcast, "You Must Rememebr This." Here's how "You Must Remember This" appears to someone scrolling through Apple Podcasts. 

Let's break down why Longworth's branding works.
