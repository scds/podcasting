    "content": "Recording professional-sounding audio at home is possible! Here are some tips from Elaine Westenhoefer from McMaster University’s Lyons New Media Centre: . First, optimize your at-home recording set-up. Pictured here is a drawing of a typical living room. There is a window with the curtains open, a couch in front of a television, a rug on the floor, an open air vent on the wall beside the window, and some wall shelves with items on them on the other side of the window. Simple adjustments to a room like this can positively impact audio recording quality. Pictured here is the same living room, but with a few adjustments made. The curtains are closed. | Fabric is an excellent sound-absorber. As you close the curtains, you are creating more fabric surface area, which will reduce echo in your audio recording. Some people even like to record in their closets because of the natural insulation provided by their clothes. | . The television is turned off. | Electronics, such as televisions are sources of background noise. Even when on a low volume or muted, these devices omit electrical noise, which are audio waves that can be picked up by microphones. It is best to turn off or unplug these devices. | . The air vent is closed. | Blowing air is a source of background noise. This makes for an even worse recording when the circulation system turns on and off throughout the recording – This can be difficult to edit out. Either close any vents near you, or better yet, turn the system off while you record. | . The clock is gone from the shelf. | Quietly sit in the recording space and listen for any additional sources of noise, such as ticking clocks. Remove these from your recording environment. | . ",

For long recordings, consider breaking up your script into smaller segments. | Set your phone to airplane mode or do not disturb to prevent any distractions or notification noises. | Locate where the microphone is on your phone. Make sure it is not covered and that it is pointed at you when you record. | You can use a piece of fabric or even a sock to cover the bottom of your phone, to act as a wind shield. | Make sure the mic is about 8 inches from your face when recording.

Also called “graphic collateral,” this is like the movie poster equivalent of a podcast. It includes an image, symbol, and/or font, all of which have the capacity to convey meaning. | . | . Collectively, these three things must hook listeners by communicating a tremendous amount of information–topic, tone, the show’s identity–in a very small space.

    "title": "Case Study: You Must Remember This",
    "content": "Let’s look at an example of a podcast that branded itself well: Karina Longworth’s Old Hollywood podcast, “You Must Rememebr This.” Here’s how “You Must Remember This” appears to someone scrolling through Apple Podcasts. Let’s break down why Longworth’s branding works. Show Title: “You Must Remember This” is a brilliant title. It grabs the reader with its direct address and, through its imperative voice, orders us to tune in and “remember” alongside Longworth. We “must”! The phrase that forms the title also cleverly mixes old and new, breathing life into historical material. We still use the phrase “you must remember this” in casual conversation, making the title fresh and relevant to a modern audience, but it’s also a line from what is perhaps the most famous old Hollywood movie ever, Casablanca. The line occurs when Sam sings “You must remember this, a kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh…” . Logline: “A podcast exploring the secret and/or forgotten histories of Hollywood’s first century.” This logline works because it describes its topic (Old Hollywood history) and pitches its potential audience with an intriguing and unique angle (we’re not just learning about cinema history, we’re learning about “the secret and/or forgotten histories of Hollywood’s first century.”). Longworth manages to straightforwardly lay out the show’s topic and entice listeners with the promise of scandals and secret histories. This balance gives the logline its power. Tile Image: The typography evokes Old Hollywood films, with the cloth draping subtly suggesting a theatre curtain. It conveys its subject without the title explicitly needing to say “This is a show about cinema history.” The simplicity of the image is also a point in its favour. Because these images are typically displayed in quite a small size on phones and other media players, a simple design is usually best. If anything could be improved, the colour contrast could be heighteened to ensure that everyone can clearly see the difference between the text and the background. To check the colour contrast of your own image, use this contrast checker tool. ",

    "title": "Planning Individual Episodes",
    "content": "Planning a podcast means understanding the way individual segments relate to the entire show at large. Consider this chart, which breaks down the different levels of a podcast. Each podcast is made of seasons (if applicable), which are in turn composed of linked episodes. These episodes are, in turn, made up of segments. You can think of a podcast episode’s segments the way you think about an essay. Shows typically begin with an introduction, followed by the body of the show, then end with a conclusion. You can get creative with all these elements, but the most diversity is usually found in the body, so let’s zoom in on that. The body of a podcast may be a discussion between co-hosts, a formal interview, a debate, a scripted monologue, or something else entirely. Within each of these formats, there are even more sub-categories. If you’re doing a guided discussion, what topics will you cover and in what order? If an interview, you have to plan your questions ahead of time and make sure they flow. If a debate, which side goes first? Will you include rebuttals? And so on and so forth. The big point here is that you can’t just sit down and record. You need to draft your episode ahead of time and understand its different segments and how they relate to the episode and the show at large. In other words, you need an outline and oftentimes, especially in repeated elements like an introductory greeting and a sign off, you need a script. ",
